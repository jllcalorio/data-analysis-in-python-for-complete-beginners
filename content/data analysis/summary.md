**Congratulations!** You've completed the Data Analysis with Python section and significantly expanded your data analysis capabilities. Let's review what you've accomplished:

In this section, you learned how to use Python for real-world data analysis, focusing on tools like ```Pandas```, ```Matplotlib```, ```Seaborn```, and ```sklearn```. The goal was to equip you with practical skills to clean, transform, analyze, and visualize data effectively.

{% include question.html header="What You've Learned" text="

- **Introduction to Pandas** — Understanding Series and DataFrames, the foundation of data manipulation.
- **Reading and Loading Data** — Importing data from CSV, Excel, and other sources.
- **Data Querying and Selection** — Selecting specific rows, columns, and subsets using conditions and queries.
- **Data Filtering and Transformation** — Grouping, aggregating, and creating new derived variables.
- **Data Visualization** — Creating effective visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore and communicate insights.
- **Statistical Analysis** — Applying descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests, correlation, and regression techniques.
- **Exercises** — Hands-on practice covering visualization, t-tests, and logistic regression.

{% include question.html header="Learning Outcomes" text="

- By the end of this module, you were able to:
- Load and explore real-world datasets using Pandas.
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation tasks.
- Create insightful visualizations to understand data patterns and trends.
- Conduct statistical analyses to test hypotheses and model relationships.
- Apply regression models for predictive insights.

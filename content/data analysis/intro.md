Welcome to the exciting world of data analysis!

This section will help you move beyond basic Python programming and show you how to turn **health and clinical data** into meaningful insights that can inform **patient care, research, and medical education**.

You’ll learn to use powerful Python libraries such as:

- **pandas** — for cleaning and analyzing patient datasets
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** — for creating clear, evidence-based visualizations
- **scipy** — for performing statistical tests and clinical comparisons

By the end of this section, you’ll be able to:

- **Load and explore datasets** from sources such as hospital records or surveys
- **Clean and transform** messy data (e.g., missing values in lab tests)
- **Visualize patterns** such as blood pressure trends or lab result distributions
- **Perform basic statistical analyses** to support clinical and research conclusions

## Introduction to Data Analysis Libraries

{% include question.html header="Essential libraries" text="

Before diving into analysis, let’s explore the core Python libraries that make data analysis possible — and how they apply to the medical field.

```python
import pandas as pd              # Data manipulation and analysis
import numpy as np               # Numerical computing
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Basic plotting
import seaborn as sns            # Statistical data visualization
from scipy import stats          # Statistical functions
```

**Variables** are like **containers that store information** â€” think of them as labeled drawers where you can keep different kinds of data such as a patientâ€™s name, age, or blood pressure.

In Python, you donâ€™t have to specify what type of data a variable will hold â€” Python automatically figures that out for you!

{% include question.html header="Creating Variables" text="

Creating variables is simple.

It's not an exaggeration that variables are going to be your friends in the long run.

```python
patient_name = 'Maria Santos'
patient_age = 45
patient_bmi = 24.6
has_diabetes = True

print(patient_name)   # Output: Maria Santos
print(patient_age)    # Output: 45
```
**Example context:** Imagine youâ€™re storing basic information from a patientâ€™s medical record â€” each variable holds one detail about the patient.

**Mini Exercise**

**Try It Yourself** ðŸ§ 
Create three variables to store:
- A patientâ€™s heart rate (in beats per minute)
- Their body temperature (in Â°C)
- Whether they are currently admitted (True or False)
- Then, print all three variables!

{% include question.html header="Bonus: Comments" text="

Comments are lines in the code that are ignored by the interpreter and serve as notes or explanations for humans reading the code.

- A comment starts with the '#' symbol and continues to the end of the line.
- Python also supports multi-line comments using triple quotes (''' or \"\"\"), though these are technically treated as multi-line strings unless assigned or used in docstrings (used later on in the 'Control Structures' section).

{% include question.html header="Variable Naming Rules" text="

- Must start with a letter or underscore (_)
- Avoid using a single underscore as a variable name
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case-sensitive (```name``` and ```Name``` are different)
- Cannot use Python keywords (like ```if```, ```for```, ```while```, ```class```, ```def```, ```list```, ```str```)
- Avoid names starting and ending with double underscores (```__init__```, ```__str__```). These are reserved for **special methods** in Python classes
- Use lowercase letters with underscores (snake_case) for variable names
- Make names meaningful and specific to their purpose
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're widely understood (```num``` is okay, ```nm``` is not)

**Good variable names**

```python
user_name = \"john_doe\"
total_score = 95
is_valid = True
```

**Avoid these**

```python
x = \"john_doe\"         # Not descriptive, but usable
userName = \"john_doe\"  # Use snake_case in Python, but usable
2name = \"invalid\"      # Cannot start with number
```

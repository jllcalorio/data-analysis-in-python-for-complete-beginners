**Congratulations!** You’ve now mastered the **fundamental building blocks of Python programming** — an essential skill for today’s data-driven healthcare environment.

{% include question.html header="Key Concepts Mastered" text="

- **Variables** — storing and managing data such as patient age, height, or blood test results
- **Data Types** — working with strings (names), integers (counts), floats (measurements), and Booleans (True/False health flags)
- **Operators** — performing calculations and comparisons for medical indicators (e.g., BMI, dosage checks)
- **Lists** — organizing collections like medication names or lab values
- **Dictionaries** — storing structured data such as patient profiles or electronic medical records
- **String Formatting** — presenting readable reports or summaries for clinicians
- **Control Structures** — making automated decisions (e.g., flagging abnormal lab results) and repeating routine tasks using loops and functions

{% include question.html header="Skills You Can Now Apply" text="
With these fundamentals, you can now:

- Store and manipulate clinical or research data
- Organize patient information using lists and dictionaries
- Automate decision rules and workflows with if-statements and loops
- Write reusable functions to calculate medical indices or summarize datasets
- Format output for reports, dashboards, or data summaries
- Debug and improve your scripts — a key step toward reliable data analysis
" %}

{% include question.html header="What's Next?" text="

You’re now ready to advance to **Intermediate Python for Medical Data Analysis**, where you’ll:

- Build more complex functions and automate routine reports
- Use modules and libraries such as ```pandas```, ```matplotlib```, and ```numpy``` for data handling and visualization
- Handle data errors gracefully
- Develop scalable programs for hospital or research settings

The foundation you’ve built here will support your journey into **data analysis, clinical research, and AI-driven health solutions**.

Keep practicing — coding is a skill best learned through experimentation and application!

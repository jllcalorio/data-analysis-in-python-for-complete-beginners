**Congratulations!** You've learned the fundamental building blocks of Python programming:

{% include question.html header="Key Concepts Mastered" text="

- **Variables:** Storing and managing data
- **Data Types:** Working with strings, integers, floats, and Booleans
- **Operators:** Performing calculations and comparisons
- **Lists:** Organizing multiple items in order
- **Dictionaries:** Storing key-value pairs for structured data
- **String Formatting:** Creating professional, readable output
- **Control Structures:** Making decisions and repeating actions with if statements, loops, and functions
" %}

{% include question.html header="Skills You Can Now Apply" text="

- Store and manipulate different types of data
- Organize information using lists and dictionaries
- Control program flow with conditional statements and loops
- Create reusable code with functions
- Format output professionally
- Debug basic programming errors
" %}

{% include question.html header="What's Next?" text="

You're now ready to move on to Intermediate Python, where you'll learn to:

- Write more complex functions
- Work with modules and external libraries
- Handle errors gracefully
- Build larger, more organized programs
" %}

The foundation you've built here will serve you well as we explore more advanced Python concepts. Keep practicing these fundamentals - they're the building blocks for everything else you'll learn in Python!

{% capture text %}Programming is learned by doing. Don't just read the code examples - type them out, modify them, and experiment with your own variations!

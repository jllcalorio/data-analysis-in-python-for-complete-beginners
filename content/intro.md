## Getting Started

Ready to begin your Python journey? Let's dive into the fundamentals and start building your programming skills from the ground up. The next section will introduce you to the basic building blocks of Python programming.

**Important**: Before the workshop begins, please install **Python** and **Anaconda** on your laptop. Don’t worry — we’ll guide you step by step during the first session.

{% include question.html header="Let's install Python in your computer!" text="
1. To **download Python**, go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and click '**Download Python x.xx.x**'. There are separate download options depending on your operating system (OS), example, Windows, macOS, Linux, etc. Double-click the downloaded file and follow the default options for installation.
2. To **download Anaconda**, go to [https://www.anaconda.com/download/success](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) and click one of the options under \"**Distribution Installers**\". Double-click the downloaded file and follow the default options for installation.
  - Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing. It simplifies package management and deployment, making it the standard choice for data science.

Once installed, open **Anaconda Navigator**, find **Jupyter Notebook**, and click **Launch** — you’re ready to code!

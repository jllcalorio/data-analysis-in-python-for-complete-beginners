**Congratulations!** You've completed the Intermediate Python section and significantly expanded your programming capabilities. Let's review what you've accomplished:

## What You’ve Mastered

{% include question.html header="Advanced Functions" text="

- Handled parameters like ```*args```, ```**kwargs```, and default values
- Used **lambda** and **higher-order functions**
- Added **type hints** and **docstrings** for clarity
- Designed **clean, reusable, well-structured** functions
" %}

{% include question.html header="Modules and Packages" text="

- Imported and organized code effectively
- Used **built-in modules** (e.g., ```math```, ```datetime```, ```os```)
- Created **custom modules** for reuse
- Structured projects with **packages** and ```__init__.py```
- Followed best practices for **importable and testable** code
" %}

{% include question.html header="Error Handling" text="

- Understood **common exception types**
- Used ```try-except``` and ```finally``` for controlled error management
- Defined **custom exceptions** for specific use cases
- Practiced **debugging and robust programming** techniques
" %}

## Real-World Applications You Built

{% include question.html header="Through the exercises, you've built:" text="

- **Advanced BMI Calculator** – a simple module (```bmi_calculator.py```) that computes **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
- **Medication Dosage Calculator** – a function that calculates a child’s **drug dosage** based on weight
- **Heart Rate Evaluator** – a function that classifies a **resting heart rate**
" %}

## Key Programming Principles You Now Understand:

{% include question.html header="Code Organization" text="

- Break big problems into smaller, logical **functions**
- Group related logic into **modules**
- Use the if ```__name__ == "__main__"```: guard properly
" %}

{% include question.html header="Error Prevention and Handling" text="

- Anticipate and validate inputs
- Provide **clear, actionable error messages**
- Catch specific errors instead of using ```generic except```
" %}

{% include question.html header="Professional Practices" text="

- Add **type hints** and **docstrings**
- Follow **PEP 8 naming conventions**
- Write simple **nit tests** for critical functions
" %}

## What You Can Build Now

{% include question.html header="Intermediate Applications" text="

- Multi-file **Python applications** with good structure
- Programs that handle files and user input safely
- **Utilities and modules** that others can import and use
- Apps with **graceful error handling** and informative output
" %}

{% include question.html header="Next Steps" text="

You’re ready for Advanced Python topics, such as:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Databases and APIs
- Web development frameworks
- Data Science libraries (```pandas```, ```numpy```, ```matplotlib```, ```scipy```)
" %}

## Next Steps:

The foundation you've built here will serve you well as we move into Data Analysis with Python, where you'll apply these skills to real-world data problems using powerful libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.

**Remember:**

The best way to master Python is through consistent practice.

Type out the examples.
Experiment with your own variations.
Break your code. Fix it. Learn from it.
Every function you write strengthens your foundation.
